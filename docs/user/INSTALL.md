# Install

## DMG Install

1. Download `Chiselo-0.1.27.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JunZhaoNathan/Chiselo/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG.
3. Drag `Chiselo.app` to `Applications`.
4. Launch Chiselo from `Applications`.

Current preview builds are Developer ID signed when the signing identity is available. Release packaging can be notarized and stapled with `CHISELO_NOTARIZE=1 scripts/package-dmg.sh`. If macOS blocks the first launch, try these in order:

1. Move `Chiselo.app` to `Applications`, then Finder right-click -> `Open`.
2. Check `System Settings -> Privacy & Security` for an `Open Anyway` button.
3. If macOS says the app is damaged or should be moved to Trash, and you trust the download, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Chiselo.app
```

The DMG includes `README.txt` and `Release Notes.txt` with the current installation, signing, and release information.
