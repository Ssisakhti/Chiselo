# Changelog

All notable changes to Chiselo will be documented here.

## 0.1.26 - 2026-09-22

- Prevented the document roots from being selected, edited, moved, duplicated,
  arranged, or deleted in direct HTML mode.
- Made hierarchy navigation skip hidden and non-editable runtime nodes.
- Preserved sub-pixel local frames during text edits so neighboring modules do
  not move, while keeping overflow visible in delivery diagnostics.
- Invalidated canvas measurements only for structural element changes, allowing
  deletion to shrink the page without responsive reflow during text edits.
- Removed the duplicate responsive-preview render and fixed latent quick-action
  insertion dispatch.
- Added WKWebView coverage for root protection, filtered navigation, and canvas
  shrink after deletion.
- Bumped the Sparkle build number to `26` and published signed update metadata.

## 0.1.25 - 2026-08-09

- Bound asynchronous save, export, and editable-layout conversion to the tab
  that initiated the operation, and disabled tab switching and closing until
  the operation finishes.
- Preserved the source tab's unsaved state when editable-layout conversion
  fails before creating the converted document.
- Made history restoration use a prepared temporary file, atomic replacement,
  and rollback so a failed restore cannot delete the current document.
- Made editable HTML runtime injection idempotent and added coverage for
  repeated export.
- Fixed WebKit canvas interaction coverage by hosting the test view in a real
  noninteractive window, preventing hidden-page timer suspension during zoomed
  resize and text-edit assertions.
- Preserved each converted text fragment exactly once and kept selection and
  direct edits isolated to the selected object.
- Bumped the Sparkle build number to `25` so existing `0.1.24` installations
  can receive this update.
- Added build-fingerprint query keys to release download URLs so a rebuilt
  artifact cannot be confused with stale CDN bytes from the same version.

## 0.1.24 - 2026-08-05

- Changed the source license to CC BY-NC 4.0. Commercial use now
  requires prior written permission; this is source-available rather than
  OSI-approved open source. Historical releases through `v0.1.23` retain the
  Apache-2.0 license supplied with those releases.

## 0.1.23 - 2026-08-03

- Replaced the non-commercial source-available license with Apache-2.0 and
  added a separate Chiselo Trademark Policy for product identity.
- Made PDF and PPTX export retain static-safe script and remote-resource
  restrictions unless the user explicitly chose trusted dynamic compatibility.
- Added safe-export runtime coverage and made release preflight work when
  `rg` is unavailable on the CI runner.
- Made the WebKit deck-gesture regression wait for the editor runtime instead
  of assuming it is ready on the first callback.
- Made PPTX design checks portable on CI runners without `rg`.

## 0.1.22 - 2026-08-02

- Fixed direct HTML selection boxes drifting from their visible target after an embedded responsive preview scrolls. The overlay now aligns to the iframe's actual on-screen bounds without changing document geometry, styles, or source.
- Added real-WebKit regression coverage for clicking a responsive-preview input after scrolling the embedded page: the selected target must remain the input itself and all four selection-box edges must align within two screen pixels.
- Bumped the source version to `0.1.22` and the Sparkle build number to `22`.

## 0.1.21 - 2026-08-02

- HTML documents now always open at 100% CSS-pixel scale. Window resize, inspector changes, object selection, local edits, and responsive device-width previews no longer change zoom unless the user explicitly asks.
- Added explicit toolbar controls for `100%` and `fit width`; Cmd/Ctrl plus wheel remains the direct manual zoom gesture.
- Reworked table-internal selection so it exposes working safe actions for text editing, whole-table selection, row/column changes, alignment, and cell presets while hiding geometry, nudge, alignment, and layer controls that the editor correctly refuses to apply.
- Added real-WebKit regression coverage on imported HTML for initial 100% scale, window resize stability, responsive-preview stability, explicit fit-width, and explicit 100% restoration.
- Fixed local ad-hoc app bundles on macOS: their main executable now carries the development-only library-validation entitlement needed to load the bundled Sparkle framework. Developer ID builds continue to use same-team framework signing.
- Bumped the source version to `0.1.21` and the Sparkle build number to `21`.

## 0.1.20 - 2026-08-02

- Bumped the source version to `0.1.20` and the Sparkle build number to `20`.
- Extracted browser-bridge payload decoding from `EditorModel.swift` into a stateless decoder without changing editor geometry, gesture state, DOM mutation, or save ownership.
- Completed decoding for the box-model, layout, position, opacity, typography, and stylesheet-writeback fields already returned by the browser, so the Inspector now receives the rendered state instead of silently dropping those values.
- Added XCTest coverage for complete selection payloads, malformed required geometry, non-finite coordinates, mixed scalar types, nested item filtering, stylesheet matches, and source-draft mappings.
- Revalidated high-zoom drag, resize, cross-frame release, zoom preservation, zoom-out stability, and zero-collateral edits against the sample page, operations dashboard, editorial brief, and delivery form.

## 0.1.19 - 2026-08-02

- Bumped the source version to `0.1.19` and the Sparkle build number to `19`.
- Made resize operations on flow-managed HTML elements use local transform scaling so the selected object changes size without expanding its layout slot or moving unrelated content.
- Extended zero-collateral regressions with real target movement and resizing while checking complete computed styles, `::before` and `::after`, geometry, and independently comparable DOM source across up to 120 non-target nodes.
- Added high-zoom pointer regressions for cross-frame drag release, screen-to-document coordinate conversion, resize-handle accuracy, zoom preservation, post-release stability, and zoom-out selection stability.
- Revalidated the strengthened geometry and zoom contract against the sample page, operations dashboard, editorial brief, and delivery form, and made all four cases part of release preflight.

## 0.1.18 - 2026-08-02

- Bumped the source version to `0.1.18` and the Sparkle build number to `18`.
- Strengthened zero-collateral regressions to compare every computed style property, `::before` and `::after` pseudo-element styles, geometry, and independently comparable `outerHTML` across up to 120 visible non-target nodes.
- Revalidated the stronger invariant against the synthetic isolation fixture and four bundled real HTML pages.
- Extracted resize, snap, distance, rectangle, and overflow calculations from `editor.js` into `editor-geometry.js` behind a frozen dependency-free API.
- Added focused geometry boundary coverage and packaged-resource verification without moving gesture state or DOM write operations out of the main editor runtime.

## 0.1.17 - 2026-08-02

- Bumped the source version to `0.1.17` and the Sparkle build number to `17`.
- Strengthened zero-collateral editing regressions so every unrelated peer must retain byte-identical live DOM source in addition to unchanged geometry and computed visual style.
- Revalidated the synthetic isolation fixture, sample page, operations dashboard, editorial brief, and delivery form with the stricter invariant.
- Extracted HTML diagnostics presentation calculations from `ContentView.swift` without changing scores, recommendations, or UI behavior.
- Extracted file decoding and open-tab input parsing from `EditorModel.swift`, and removed an unused result-count helper.
- Extracted source-node matching, stable object-ID preservation, and source-draft mapping review from `editor.js` into `source-mapping.js` behind an explicit dependency interface.
- Extracted pure visual-change filtering, classification, summaries, writeback labeling, and rollback eligibility from `editor.js` into `visual-change.js`; DOM capture and mutations remain in the main runtime.
- Added standalone visual-change module syntax and filter coverage to release preflight while retaining the existing rollback integration regressions.

## 0.1.16 - 2026-08-02

- Bumped the source version to `0.1.16` and the Sparkle build number to `16`.
- Added local edit frame isolation so text, typography, line-height, and padding changes do not push unrelated modules or downstream sections.
- Added a zero-collateral edit regression covering target, sibling-card, and following-section geometry and visual style stability.
- Verified zero-collateral editing against the bundled sample page, operations dashboard, editorial brief, and delivery form.
- Classified automatic frame preservation separately from user-authored inline style changes, and made text-change rollback remove its associated frame protection.
- Added native WebKit content rules that block remote HTTP/HTTPS page resources in static-safe mode and are removed only after trusted dynamic compatibility is confirmed.
- Added native navigation policy that prevents imported pages from replacing the Chiselo editor shell.
- Added a formal SwiftPM XCTest target for save transactions and runtime security policy, including real WebKit content-rule compilation.
- Moved delivery-check views, visual snapshot data, and safe-runtime HTML transforms into independently compiled modules.
- Made `swift test`, runtime safety syntax, and zero-collateral editing part of the complete release preflight.
- Removed unrelated INKMOSS/TRIZ prototype scripts and regenerated build/output artifacts from the final source tree.

## 0.1.15 - 2026-08-02

- Bumped the package version to `0.1.15` and the Sparkle build number to `15`.
- Added protected modified-tab close and application quit flows with Save, Cancel, and Don't Save choices.
- Made HTML plus changed linked local CSS saving transactional, with pre-commit snapshots and automatic rollback after partial commit failure.
- Made imported HTML static-safe by default and added an explicit trusted dynamic compatibility mode for scripts and forms.
- Preserved untouched HTML byte for byte and delayed DOM serialization until a real edit occurs.
- Added ordinary and advanced workspace modes; DOM/source/layer/runtime/PPTX complexity is hidden by default.
- Added exact original, desktop (`1440px`), tablet (`768px`), and phone (`390px`) responsive viewport controls that do not modify document state.
- Added deterministic rollback, runtime safety, and responsive viewport regressions to release preflight.
- Upgraded GitHub CI to execute the complete release preflight on every push and pull request.
- Extracted toolbar workspace/runtime/viewport controls from the main SwiftUI view and save persistence from the editor model.
- Centralized release version metadata and strengthened online Sparkle verification with appcast signature, exact feed, and DMG SHA-256 checks.
- Removed stale local build products, old package outputs, account caches, machine-specific release identity data, and obsolete design-audit screenshots from the working tree.

## 0.1.14 - 2026-06-28

- Bumped the package version to `0.1.14` and the Sparkle build number to `14`.
- Locked direct geometry editing for table-internal HTML structures (`td`, `th`, rows, table sections, captions, and descendants inside cells) so Markdown-exported tables no longer clip text after accidental drag or resize attempts.
- Kept table-internal objects selectable for text, style, and table row/column operations, while whole `table` elements remain movable/resizable.
- Rebuilt and hid selection resize handles whenever a selection changes between free geometry objects and table-locked objects.
- Added a Markdown-style table overflow fixture and regression test covering a long call-to-action cell from the TRIZPLUS file.

## 0.1.13 - 2026-06-28

- Bumped the package version to `0.1.13` and the Sparkle build number to `13`.
- Added packaged-build version and build fingerprint display to the toolbar, including dirty working-tree content in the fingerprint to prevent ambiguous same-version builds.
- Rebalanced the main split view around the center canvas with narrower navigator/inspector defaults and a wider minimum editor area.
- Renamed the HTML page overlay label to `Content Boundary` so canvas guides no longer imply that the page itself has resized.
- Reworked the inspector into common editing first: `Content / Appearance / Position / Layers / Source`.
- Added inspector-side direct text editing for the selected text object only.
- Hid editor overlay layers from assistive technologies and added clearer accessibility labels to the object tree.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-06-27

- Added Sparkle update checking for packaged macOS builds with a `Check for Updates…` menu entry.
- Added Chiselo-specific Sparkle Ed25519 key/appcast tooling.
- Updated DMG packaging to embed and sign `Sparkle.framework`, write `SUPublicEDKey` and `SUFeedURL`, optionally notarize/staple with `CHISELO_NOTARIZE=1`, and generate signed appcast XML files after the final DMG is ready.
- Stabilized direct HTML object editing for flow-based diagrams so click, drag, resize, text edit, and single selection no longer shrink the page or move unrelated objects.
- Compacted the direct HTML object tree for high-fidelity app prototypes by hiding decorative icon nodes and treating compact controls as leaf components in the sidebar.
- Added an INKMOSS high-fidelity prototype regression covering page interactions, drag, resize, style edits, text edits, layout changes, duplicate/delete, undo/redo, and clean export.
- Kept direct HTML stage sizing stable across fixed overlays and HTML undo/redo restores so page dimensions do not unexpectedly grow, shrink, or recalculate after local edits.
- Bumped the package version to `0.1.12` and the Sparkle build number to `12`.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-06-15

- Added a first-edit backup reminder for real local HTML and Chiselo project files so users confirm the original file backup before continuing precision edits.
- Surfaced the `.chiselo-backup` filename after opening a real file and kept save-time `.chiselo-history` snapshots in place.
- Added source-cleanliness scoring to HTML preflight and save review so export checks report whether editor-only markers or temporary edit variables would leak into the saved HTML.
- Preserved original `contenteditable` and `spellcheck` attributes while direct text editing, including clean export during an active text edit.
- Added direct HTML source-cleanliness regression coverage to release preflight.
- Added conservative stylesheet-rule writeback for unique local class rules so safe style edits can update CSS instead of adding inline style.
- Expanded stylesheet-rule writeback to safe unique selectors such as `#id`, `tag.class`, and simple descendant selectors when they only target the selected object.
- Added stylesheet writeback diagnostics and regression coverage, while shared-class edits still fall back to inline style to avoid changing multiple objects unexpectedly.
- Added one-click visual rollback for safe stylesheet-rule writeback changes, restoring the original local CSS rule instead of leaving the object edited.
- Added object-level responsive-change review so modified HTML objects inside media/container/flex/grid/sticky layout chains can be located before save or export.
- Added object-level source-writeback review so inline style edits and local CSS-rule writes can be listed and located before save or export.
- Included the exact local CSS selector in source-writeback review rows so stylesheet edits show where they landed in the original HTML source.
- Made stylesheet writeback diagnostics compare current CSS rules against the original baseline, so reverted rule edits no longer appear as active save/export changes.
- Updated source-writeback review to use the active CSS-rule diagnostic count and show selector-only rows when a rule changed without a preview object row.
- Kept direct-selection quick actions compact by default, with action buttons tucked behind an on-demand menu so selected text stays visible.
- Quieted direct-selection chrome further: selected objects now show only a small on-demand action button, object labels stay inside the menu, hover labels avoid instruction text, and object right-clicks no longer open the browser menu outside text editing.
- Reduced source-review noise for external CSS pages: external stylesheets now create a save/export review only after changed objects may actually be affected.
- Added parent, child, children-group, previous/next sibling, and same-class selection correction actions to the compact quick-action menu for nested HTML.
- Added a compact HTML path inside the quick-action menu so nested objects can jump directly to an ancestor without leaving the canvas.
- Hardened direct HTML point selection through transparent overlays so review navigation and canvas clicks keep finding the real object underneath.
- Added live undo/redo availability from the editor runtime to the macOS menu and preserved redo state across direct HTML undo restores.
- Labeled undo/redo history entries so menus and toolbar help can show the next reversible action such as text edits, object moves, image replacement, and table changes.
- Added a save-before-overwrite review prompt for real HTML files summarizing backup status, visual changes, preflight issues, and an option to open the visual review before saving.
- Added visual-change review filters for all, text, image, geometry, style, and deleted changes so preflight review can focus on the kind of edit being checked.
- Added before/after details and safe one-click rollback for revertable visual-change items, with rollback actions preserved in undo history.
- Added regression coverage for reverting newly added or duplicated HTML objects from visual-change review.
- Added safe one-click restore for deleted HTML objects when the original parent location is still available.
- Added one-click rollback buttons to source-review rows so inline style and CSS-rule writebacks can be reverted directly from export preflight.
- Added responsive-layout and source-writeback review signals so save/export preflight can flag multi-width checks and inline-style changes on stylesheet-backed HTML.
- Added breakpoint-aware responsive review hints so changed HTML objects show nearby widths to check before save or export.
- Added selected-object source writeback hints so users can see whether style edits will update a CSS rule or inline style before changing HTML.
- Added a selected-object source sync panel that shows, edits, applies, copies, and re-locates a clean HTML snippet for the visual selection.
- Added source-snippet structure validation so dangerous tags/handlers are blocked and tag, ID, or class changes are called out before applying visual-source edits.
- Added a compact source-draft change summary so users can see changed, added, or removed snippet lines before applying edits.
- Expanded the source-draft summary with tag and child-object count changes so structural edits are clearer before applying.
- Added a restore action for source snippet drafts so users can return to the current selected object's clean original snippet before applying edits.
- Kept the source editor draft synchronized after applying a source snippet so the panel reflects the actual selected object HTML immediately.
- Preserved matching child-object edit IDs when applying source snippets so visual-source navigation stays stable after source edits.
- Added a clickable source-path breadcrumb for selected HTML objects so parent containers can be reselected from the source sync panel.
- Added source-sibling navigation so neighboring objects under the same parent can be reselected from the source sync panel.
- Added source-child navigation from selected HTML source snippets so rows inside the snippet can reselect the real rendered child object.
- Added compact quick-action regression coverage to release preflight.
- Added visual-change rollback regression coverage to release preflight.
- Bumped the packaging version to `0.1.11` for the next preview build.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-06-13

- Added target lists for object-level visual changes so changed text, images, geometry, and style objects can be reviewed beyond the first changed object.
- Added a `Visual Change Review` card in export preflight with next/previous object navigation before HTML/PDF/PPTX delivery.
- Updated the sidebar delivery check to use the same visual-change target list for consistent object selection.
- Bumped the packaging version to `0.1.10` for the next preview build.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-06-13

- Added PPTX preflight `Suggested Actions` repair actions for locating tables, SVG/vector objects, complex visual effects, and layered objects from the export panel.
- Added direct preflight actions for converting dynamic or whole-object HTML into an editable version and for choosing PDF when visual fidelity is the safer delivery path.
- Kept repair actions in object-facing language so users see tables, vectors, effects, layers, editable version, and PDF rather than implementation details.
- Bumped the packaging version to `0.1.9` for the next preview build.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-06-13

- Added target lists for PPTX editable-object diagnostics so text, image, shape, review, and whole-object fallback groups can be reviewed beyond the first matching object.
- Added `Step Through` controls in the PPTX preflight report for next/previous navigation across editable objects and export-risk objects before delivery.
- Added regression coverage for multi-target PPTX review navigation and dynamic HTML whole-object fallback lists.
- Bumped the packaging version to `0.1.8` for the next preview build.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-06-13

- Added click-through targeting to the PPTX editable-object report so non-zero text, image, shape, review, and whole-object fallback counts can jump to the first matching object before export.
- Added PPTX report target IDs to HTML diagnostics and regression coverage for review-object and whole-object fallback selection.
- Reworded visible PPTX review guidance away from implementation language and toward export review actions.
- Bumped the packaging version to `0.1.7` for the next preview build.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-06-12

- Added `Convert to Editable Version` Layout IR v1: runtime HTML is captured after rendering into deterministic text, image, shape, pseudo-element, and whole-object fallback elements.
- Added an editable-version quality summary that reports directly editable text, replaceable images, adjustable shapes, approximated objects, whole-object fallbacks, and PPTX editability.
- Added deterministic module grouping metadata for captured cards, sections, tables, and visual modules so related text, shapes, and pseudo-elements can be identified together.
- Added module-group selection and refinement for editable versions: grouped cards/modules can be selected as one unit, nudged, aligned, snapped, duplicated, deleted, locked, moved together, and refined internally with same-width, same-height, and equal-spacing commands.
- Added a non-technical style panel pass for color swatches, text alignment, border/radius controls, shadow presets, and image display modes.
- Preserved shadow and image object-fit through direct HTML editing, editable-version capture, exported HTML, and deck schema validation.
- Added PPTX effect-risk preflight diagnostics for complex CSS visuals such as background images, radial/repeating gradients, filters, masks, clipping paths, blend modes, and 3D transforms.
- Added object-level visual diff v1 in delivery preflight so changed text, image, geometry, and key style edits can be reviewed against the original opened HTML.
- Added PPTX editable-object report v1 in delivery preflight, estimating editable text, image, shape, review, and whole-object fallback counts before export.
- Added editability metadata for captured objects so the Inspector can distinguish directly editable text, replaceable images, adjustable shapes, approximated pseudo-elements, and whole-object iframe/canvas fallbacks.
- Reused the same page/slide boundary selectors across editable capture and export so `.slide`, `.page`, `[data-page]`, and similar document frames map more consistently.
- Added dynamic-content diagnostics for script-rendered HTML, including runtime roots, scripts, embedded pages, canvas regions, shadow components, external runtime resources, and transparent selection blockers.
- Made dynamically inserted HTML elements, images, media, and tables join the editing and delivery-check pipeline after import.
- Added editing-only transparent overlay pass-through so empty full-page hit layers no longer block selecting the real title, image, card, table, or module underneath.
- Added dynamic-content risk rows, issue icons, scoring penalties, and export guidance to make script-rendered HTML limitations visible before HTML/PDF/PPTX delivery.
- Added a script-rendered HTML compatibility regression test.
- Bumped the packaging version to `0.1.6` for the next preview build.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-06-12

- Added geometry review metrics in the Inspector: selected objects now show page/canvas margins, center offset, and a copyable geometry summary.
- Repositioned Chiselo around "HTML finishing and delivery" instead of generated-HTML-only or slide-only editing.
- Updated user-facing app labels toward page/canvas refinement, delivery preflight, object structure, and Chiselo project files.
- Bumped the packaging version to `0.1.5` for the next preview build.
- Added semantic object labels for imported HTML so the UI can show user-facing names like page, title, image, table, card, module, and cell instead of underlying tags.
- Renamed the HTML navigation UI toward object-editing language: object structure, page objects, and layer navigation.
- Added import-adapter coverage for semantic page and table-cell recognition.
- Added visual page/canvas boundary overlays with center lines and ruler ticks for direct HTML and Chiselo project editing.
- Added page/canvas frame edges and centers to direct HTML snapping so movement and resizing can align to the detected page frame.
- Added HTML multi-selection commands for matching width/height and distributing objects horizontally or vertically.
- Added an export preflight panel with HTML/PDF readiness, PPTX editability scoring, issue navigation, and format-specific review guidance.
- Added a snapshot history browser for choosing and restoring a specific `.chiselo-history/` version.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-06-11

- Added safer real-file editing: opening a local HTML or Chiselo project file creates a one-time `.chiselo-backup` sibling copy.
- Added save-time version snapshots in a sibling `.chiselo-history/` folder for HTML and Chiselo project files.
- Preserved existing `.chiselo-backup` files across app sessions instead of replacing the earliest safety copy.
- Added a toolbar shortcut to reveal the current document's backup/history folder.
- Added a confirmed restore action for the newest `.chiselo-history/` snapshot.
- Added a safe-file-history regression test to cover backup preservation and same-second snapshot ordering.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-06-10

Stability patch focused on repeatable HTML editing and generated fixture coverage.

- Made HTML image replacement refresh after image load/layout settle so selection boxes and exports stay stable.
- Made import diagnostics tolerate pages with no images, media, SVG, or tables.
- Defaulted direct HTML layout adjustments to transform mode to reduce accidental document-flow changes.
- Added generated HTML and Chiselo project fixtures plus an editing regression script that verifies text edits, image replacement, module movement, table edits, project edits, and clean export.
- Updated release and packaging docs for the `0.1.3` preview release.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-06-10
