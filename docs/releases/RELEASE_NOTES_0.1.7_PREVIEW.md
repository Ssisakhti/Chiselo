# Chiselo 0.1.7 Preview

Chiselo is a native macOS app for high-fidelity refinement and delivery of existing HTML files.

## What Changed In 0.1.7

- Makes the `PPTX Editable Objects` report actionable: click non-zero text, image, shape, review, or whole-object counts to locate the first matching object before export.
- Adds target tracking for PPTX review objects such as tables, SVG/vector content, complex effects, and layered objects.
- Adds target tracking for whole-object fallbacks such as embedded pages, canvas regions, shadow components, and script-rendered runtime roots.
- Rewords visible PPTX guidance toward export review actions instead of implementation details.
- Updates packaging to `0.1.7`.

## Why This Matters

The PPTX report is no longer only a scorecard. It now helps users move directly from “this may need review” to the object that needs attention, which is closer to Chiselo's core workflow: inspect existing HTML, make precise visual adjustments, preflight delivery, and export.

## Install

1. Download `Chiselo-0.1.7.dmg` after the GitHub Release asset is published.
2. Open the DMG.
3. Drag `Chiselo.app` to `Applications`.
4. Launch Chiselo.

This preview build is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. If macOS blocks the first launch, read the included `First Launch Help.txt`.

For GitHub Releases, publish the final downloadable build as a normal release instead of a pre-release when the website button should always resolve to the newest asset through `/releases/latest`.

## Known Limitations

Chiselo is an early preview. Complex scripts, responsive layouts, animations, pseudo-elements, canvas pixels, closed components, cross-origin embedded pages, and perfect editable PPTX mapping for every CSS effect still need ongoing work.

For important files, keep the `.chiselo-backup` and `.chiselo-history/` files until you have reviewed the final output.
