# Chiselo 0.1.3 Preview

Chiselo is a native macOS app for refining and delivering HTML pages and visual documents.

Creator note: Chiselo was built through vibe coding by a humanities-background creator who does not come from a programming background. Thanks to Codex and GPT for making this kind of software exploration possible.

## What Changed In 0.1.3

- Improved image replacement stability by refreshing selection and diagnostics after image load/layout settle.
- Fixed delivery diagnostics for pages that have no images, media, SVG, or tables.
- Defaulted direct HTML layout adjustments to transform mode so small visual moves are less likely to alter document flow.
- Added generated HTML and Chiselo project regression fixtures.
- Added an editing regression test that exercises text edits, image replacement, module movement, table edits, project edits, duplicate/delete, and clean export.

## Who This Preview Is For

- People who already have an HTML page, document, poster, dashboard, or presentation-like file.
- People working with generated HTML and then needing a fast visual editing pass.
- Personal, educational, research, evaluation, and non-commercial hobby users.

Commercial use is not allowed under the included license.

## Highlights

- Open HTML documents and Chiselo project files (`.html`, `.htm`, `.xhtml`, `.aislide`, `.json`).
- Drag HTML files into the app.
- Select visible rendered objects directly on the canvas.
- Edit text in place.
- Move, resize, align, duplicate, delete, and adjust layer order.
- Use an object-structure fallback for nested selections.
- Replace images with embedded data URLs.
- Edit table rows, columns, cells, and common table styles.
- Run delivery checks for broken resources, clean HTML export, SVG/table notices, overflow, out-of-bounds elements, and obvious overlaps.
- Export clean standalone HTML.
- Export high-fidelity PDF.
- Export best-effort object-editable PPTX.

## Install

1. Download `Chiselo-0.1.3.dmg`.
2. Open the DMG.
3. Drag `Chiselo.app` to `Applications`.

This preview build is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. If macOS blocks the first launch, read the included `First Launch Help.txt`.

## Known Limitations

Chiselo is an early preview. The following areas are still active research:

- complex scripts;
- responsive layouts;
- pseudo-elements;
- animations;
- cross-origin resources;
- perfect PPTX mapping for every CSS effect.

For important files, work on a copy and review exported output before delivery.
