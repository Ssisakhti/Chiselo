**Chisel your HTML.**

Chiselo is a native macOS app for high-fidelity refinement and delivery of existing HTML files.

Open an existing HTML page or document, refine its text, images, tables, modules, and layout the way you would polish a deliverable, then export clean HTML, high-fidelity PDF, or the most editable PPTX it can produce.

Chiselo starts from an existing HTML document. It is a finishing and delivery workflow, not a project authoring environment. The core promise is simple:

**Bring in your HTML, refine it visually, preflight delivery, then export.**

## Download

Current source and package version: `0.1.11`.

Download the latest packaged DMG from GitHub Releases after each published build.

- [Latest Release](https://github.com/JunZhaoNathan/Chiselo/releases/latest)
- [0.1.11 Preview Notes](docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_0.1.11_PREVIEW.md)
- [Release Guide](docs/dev/RELEASE.md)

The preview build is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. If macOS blocks the first launch, the DMG includes `First Launch Help.txt` with step-by-step fixes for `Open Anyway`, Finder right-click `Open`, and quarantine removal.

## Why Chiselo

- HTML stays the editable source document.
- The browser-rendered page stays the source of truth.
- Chiselo adds object-level visual finishing controls on top of the rendered document.
- Delivery checks and exports focus on HTML/PDF/PPTX quality.
- Dynamic and script-rendered HTML is handled as a compatibility case, not the product identity.

## What You Can Do

- Open HTML documents and Chiselo project files (`.html`, `.htm`, `.xhtml`, `.aislide`, `.json`).
- Drag HTML files into the app window or onto `Chiselo.app`.
- Click directly on the rendered page to select visible objects.
- Double-click text in place to edit it.
- Drag, resize, align, nudge, duplicate, delete, and reorder elements.
- Refine typography, colors, borders, radius, shadows, and image display modes from the visual Inspector.
- Multi-select page objects with Shift/Cmd-click.
- Replace images with embedded PNG/JPG/GIF/SVG/WebP data URLs.
- Edit tables, including safer handling for `rowspan` and `colspan`.
- Run a delivery check for broken resources, SVG usage, clean HTML export, text overflow, out-of-bounds elements, and overlaps.
- Review object-level visual changes against the originally opened HTML before delivery.
- Identify script-rendered HTML, embedded pages, canvas regions, external runtime resources, and transparent selection blockers before export.
- Convert a live HTML rendering into a structured precision-editing tab.
- Export clean standalone HTML, high-fidelity PDF, and best-effort editable PPTX.

## Typical Workflow

1. Open Chiselo.
2. Drag in an existing HTML file.
3. Click a visible element on the page.
4. Edit text, move layout, adjust objects, replace images, and fix tables.
5. Run the delivery check.
6. Export HTML, PDF, or PPTX.

## Product Status

Chiselo is an early preview. It already edits rendered HTML objects and saves changes back to HTML, but complex scripts, responsive layouts, pseudo-elements, animations, cross-origin resources, and perfect multi-format output are still active research areas.

PDF remains the recommended final format when maximum fidelity matters.

## Creator Note

Chiselo's product scope is deliberately clear: make existing HTML pages and visual documents easier to refine, inspect, export, and hand off.

## Build From Source

Requirements:

- macOS 13 or newer
- Xcode command line tools
- Swift 5.9 or newer
- Node.js for helper scripts

```bash
swift run Chiselo
```

`Package.swift` is the Swift Package manifest. It tells `swift build` what the app target is, where the source lives, and which resources should be bundled, so it needs to stay at the repository root.
